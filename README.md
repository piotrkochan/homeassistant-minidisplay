## Tiny screen, lots of possibilities

- **Flexible layouts:** keep things tidy with automatic rows, or place every
  element exactly where you want it on a free-form canvas.
- **Rich content:** bring together live entities, text, clocks, weather, images,
  progress bars and rings on one tiny screen.
- **Powerful charts:** turn history into line or bar charts, show them on their
  own or behind a live value, and fine-tune their scale, colors and appearance.
- **Conditional visibility:** show or hide complete pages, rows and individual
  cards using live entity values and reusable AND/OR rules.
- **Value mappings:** turn raw entity states into clear, friendly labels and
  transform or clamp numeric values before they reach the screen.
- **Color mappings:** make changing conditions easy to spot by switching text,
  chart and background colors as live values move.
- **Deep styling:** mix custom fonts, animated backgrounds, transparent cards,
  text effects and independent title and value sizing.
- **Lively scenes:** build multi-page dashboards with timed rotation, animated
  transitions and instant on-device previews while editing.
- **Useful notifications:** place temporary, severity-aware messages above any
  dashboard without interrupting its live updates or background animations.
- **Full local control:** tune brightness, refresh rate, fonts, Wi-Fi, time and
  firmware updates from the device's own web interface.

Even animated GIFs fit comfortably: the browser resizes them for the selected
display and converts them to compact RGB565 data before upload. The firmware
decodes one scanline at a time, so smooth animation does not require holding
complete frames in precious display memory.

## Home Assistant editor

The dedicated integration adds a visual editor in HA's sidebar. Manage multiple
displays and scenes, drag and resize content, and preview changes on the device.
HA supplies entity values, weather forecasts and Recorder history.

Prefer another data source? Home Assistant is optional. Send layouts and values
directly through the [local API](#json-schema-powered).

## Install on JUZIPi SD PRO

Tested hardware: **JUZIPi SD PRO, ESP8266/ESP-12F, 4 MB flash, 240 × 240 ST7789**.
Check the [pinout](notes/pinout-sdpro.md) before flashing. Keep a stock firmware
backup and a recovery method; matching cases do not guarantee matching hardware.

1. Use the **sdpro** firmware from a [release](https://github.com/piotrkochan/homeassistant-minidisplay/releases),
   when available, or build it below. Rename it to `SDP-MiniDisplay.bin`.
2. Open the device's stock web UI and upload it through the firmware update page.
   The stock uploader requires a filename beginning with `SDP`.
3. After reboot, join `SDPRO-Setup-XXXXXX` and open `http://192.168.4.1/`.
4. Configure Wi-Fi. The screen shows its new IP address; open that address to
   configure the display and panel/API protection.

Subsequent updates use the device's **Firmware** page. Direct OTA uses `/update`,
not the stock `/update_ota`, and has a separate, configurable password.
If USB does not expose a serial port, recovery needs a **3.3 V USB-to-TTL adapter**,
not just a USB cable. Check the pinout before connecting anything.

### Add Home Assistant

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and add this repository to HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=piotrkochan&repository=homeassistant-minidisplay&category=integration)

1. In HACS, add `https://github.com/piotrkochan/homeassistant-minidisplay` as a
   custom repository, category **Integration**, and install it.
2. Restart HA. Add **Home Assistant Mini-Display** in **Settings → Devices & services**,
   or use the discovered device. Enter its address and panel/API credentials if enabled.
3. Open **Mini Displays** in the sidebar. Choose a display, create a scene and edit
   its pages. Preview on the device, then save.

Manual installation: copy `custom_components/mini_display` into HA's
`config/custom_components/` and restart.

## Hardware profiles

Only SD PRO is hardware-tested here. **Testers wanted for every other profile.**
These are build targets, not a promise that any similarly named device will work.

| Model / variant | PlatformIO target | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JUZIPi SD PRO | `sdpro` | Tested on hardware |
| GeekMagic SmallTV, no-CS wiring | `geekmagic_smalltv_nocs` | Not tested; testers needed |
| GeekMagic SmallTV / Ultra, CS on GPIO15 | `geekmagic_smalltv_cs15` | Not tested; testers needed |
| GeekMagic SmallTV ESP32-C2 / ESP8684 | `geekmagic_smalltv_esp32c2` | Not tested; testers needed |
| GeekMagic SmallTV Pro, ESP32 / 8 MB | `geekmagic_smalltv_pro` | Not tested; testers needed |

ESP32 builds provide separate `factory.bin` and `ota.bin` images. Do not interchange
them or use the SD PRO installation procedure for another model. See the
[hardware notes](notes/) and report your exact board, MCU and wiring when testing.

## JSON Schema powered

The [dashboard schema](dashboard/dashboard.schema.json) describes layouts, cards,
styles, visibility and data bindings. The device also serves it at
`/schema/dashboard.schema.json`.

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `PUT /api/v1/dashboard` | Upload a dashboard |
| `PATCH /api/v1/data` | Send values and optional chart history |
| `GET /api/v1/data` | Read retained values and history |
| `GET /api/v1/assets` | List images or download one by id |
| `PUT /api/v1/assets` | Upload an optimized image |
| `DELETE /api/v1/assets` | Delete an image |
| `POST /api/v1/notifications` | Show a temporary notification overlay |
| `DELETE /api/v1/notifications` | Dismiss all visible and queued notifications |
| `GET /api/v1/screenshot` | Capture the display as BMP |

Data keys need not be HA entity IDs. Your own application can send, for example:

```json
{"values":{"power":{"state":"156","available":true}},"render":true}
```

Bind a card to `"source": "power"`. See [the format and API notes](dashboard/README.md).
Send temporary [notification overlays](docs/notifications.md) through the local API
or Home Assistant automations, with a title, message, icon and severity.

Protected endpoints use the configured panel/API credentials. **Keep the display
on a trusted LAN; HTTPS is currently disabled in the default build.**

## Notifications

Notifications are temporary overlays displayed above the current dashboard.
They do not replace the saved scene, and entity updates and automatic page
rotation continue underneath. The queue holds three messages in total. A device
setting controls whether one, two or three are visible at once, and each visible
notification has its own timeout.

![Notification overlay above an animated dashboard](docs/screenshots/device/notification.gif)

Send a notification directly through the local API:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PANEL_API_PASSWORD' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"title":"Charging complete","message":"The battery is ready","icon":"check","severity":"success","durationSeconds":12}' \
  http://DISPLAY_IP/api/v1/notifications
```

`title` or `message` is required. Supported severities are `info`, `success`,
`warning`, `error` and `critical`; built-in icons include `bell`, `info`,
`check`, `warning`, `error`, `power` and `door`. Duration can be 1–300 seconds.
Omit `icon`, `severity`, `durationSeconds` or `position` to use their defaults.

Dismiss every visible and queued notification:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PANEL_API_PASSWORD' \
  http://DISPLAY_IP/api/v1/notifications
```

HTTP Basic authentication with the configured panel/API username and password
is also supported. Notification API protection is enabled by default and is
configured independently under **Display → Notifications**. Set the panel/API
credentials under **Security**. Because the default build uses HTTP, credentials
are not encrypted in transit; keep the display on a trusted LAN.

Home Assistant automations can use the integration actions instead of calling
the endpoint directly:

```yaml
action: mini_display.notify
data:
  device_id: your_display_device_id
  title: Charging complete
  message: The battery is ready
  icon: check
  severity: success
  duration: 12
```

To dismiss all notifications from Home Assistant:

```yaml
action: mini_display.dismiss_notifications
data:
  device_id: your_display_device_id
```

These are the integration's two custom actions. Other display commands are
exposed as Home Assistant entities and use standard Home Assistant actions.

<details>
<summary>Other Home Assistant controls</summary>

| Standard action | Mini-Display entities | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `button.press` | Next page, Previous page | Navigate without changing the automatic rotation setting |
| `button.press` | Reload dashboard | Send the active scene to the display again |
| `button.press` | Dismiss notifications | Clear visible and queued notifications |
| `button.press` | Restart | Restart the display |
| `select.select_option` | Active page | Select a page or return to automatic rotation |
| `select.select_option` | Scene | Activate a configured dashboard scene |
| `select.select_option` | Notification position | Change the default overlay position |
| `select.select_option` | Time zone | Change the display clock time zone |
| `switch.turn_on`, `switch.turn_off` | Automatic page rotation | Enable or pause timed page changes |
| `switch.turn_on`, `switch.turn_off` | Periodic data updates | Enable or pause entity-state forwarding |
| `number.set_value` | Brightness | Set display brightness as a percentage and turn the display on |
| `number.set_value` | Pixel shift | Configure periodic content movement to reduce image retention |
| `number.set_value` | Maximum refresh rate | Limit physical display refreshes |
| `light.turn_on`, `light.turn_off` | Display | Control display power and brightness |

Use the entity ID generated for your display. For example:

```yaml
action: button.press
target:
  entity_id: button.kitchen_display_next_page
```

</details>

The device web panel provides notification placement, visible-count and test
controls under **Display → Notifications**. See the
[notification reference](docs/notifications.md) for positions, limits, response
codes and rendering behavior.

## Build

Requires Python 3, Node.js 24, npm and Make.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install platformio==6.1.19
npm ci --prefix firmware/web
make build
```

SD PRO output: `firmware/.pio/build/sdpro/firmware.bin`.
`make build-all` packages all profiles into `dist/`.

For HA frontend development: `npm ci --prefix integration/card`, then
`make card-check card-build`. Native firmware tests: `make test-native`
(requires a C++17 compiler). Memory report: `make elf-report` after building.

GitHub CI checks firmware, native tests, the HA integration and browser interactions
on code changes. Releases require passing checks. HACS validation runs separately
for public repositories and weekly to catch upstream compatibility changes.
